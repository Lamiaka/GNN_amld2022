## GNN - workshop at AMLD 2022
The focus of the workshop is on modeling with GNN on Structured Data. We will not be talking about Problem Framing, Data Prep or Evaluation (which are encouraged and you should spend time on before creating any complex models). We will also use the simplest non-engineered data.
